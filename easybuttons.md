# GitLab HA Scaling Runner Vending Machine for AWS

> **Note:** The easy button code in this project is easy to reuse as a pattern to create your own easy button setups for the CloudFormation Console UI or the CLI.

> **Note:** That you can deploy as many of these as you wish as many times as you wish to build runner clusters with the appropriate attributes.

> **Note:** The automation that underlies the Easy Buttons complies with Amazon Well Architected and is capable of being used directly or as a template starting point for creating very advanced Runner ASGs.
